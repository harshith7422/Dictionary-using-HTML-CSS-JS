# Dictionary App

A simple, web-based dictionary application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, styled to resemble LinkedIn's clean and professional UI. The app allows users to search for word definitions, parts of speech, and example sentences using the free [DictionaryAPI.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling with LinkedIn-inspired design, including custom fonts, colors, and shadows.
- **JavaScript**: Handles API requests, DOM manipulation, and event listeners.
- **DictionaryAPI.dev**: Free API for retrieving word data.

## Setup

1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone this repository or download the `index.html` file.

2. **Run the App**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   - No server or dependencies are required, as the app is a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## File Structure

```
